Dear TCGS users; 

This program has svereal section: 

- data.reading

- standardizing function

- residualinzing

- standardizing

- Checking.results

- Exporting Data


At first, you can download and open "Main.R" file and follow steps: 

1- Save your data into "setwd" directory without header. You should only know the column numbers of your variables. For example, as seen in "data.reading" section, #col1 is the "PID" or #col5 is the "gender". 

2- Replac all "TargetVar" with "Your_Variable_Name", e.g., "tg". 

3- Run all lines in R and follow your data in ".sav" and ".csv" format in your directory. 

Note: Before using transformed variables into your own analysis, please check and compare qqplots and histograms for makeing a final decision.
